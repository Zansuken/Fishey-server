# Fisheye - server
This is a project made for my [Application's developer - Javascript React courses](https://openclassrooms.com/en/paths/516-developpeur-dapplication-javascript-react) from [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/en).

## How to run
For you to test the client side there is the [repository](https://github.com/Zansuken/Fisheye), then follow these instructions for both projects at their respective roots:

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
1. Run `npm run dev` to start the server.
